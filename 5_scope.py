# Create a global variable:
# counter = 0
#
# Write a function increase_counter() that:
#   - uses the 'global' keyword
#   - increases counter by 2 each time it is called
#   - prints the updated value
#
# Call the function three times and observe how the global variable changes.
# 
# Write your code here:

counter = 0

def increase_counter():
    global counter
    counter+=2
    print(counter)

print(f"\nbefore function {counter}")
increase_counter()
increase_counter()
increase_counter()
print(f"after function: {counter}")
